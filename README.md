# Banter Box

Banter Box is a lightweight chat / social interaction demo project. It provides a basic UI and backend integration to demonstrate sending messages, user authorization, and simple chat flows. This repository is intended for learning and experimentation.

## Features

- Simple chat interface
- User authorization (demo)
- Local development setup

## Authorization Notice

Important: This project uses a dummy mobile number for authorization in demos and tests. The number used is **+1 980-980-9809** (formatted as +19809809809). No real mobile number is used for authorization in this repository.

If you see a prompt asking for a mobile number during development or in screenshots, it is a placeholder/dummy number only.

2. Install dependencies (example for Node.js projects):
